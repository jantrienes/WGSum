1 . moderate pulmonary edema with stable moderate cardiomegaly and increased small left pleural effusion . 2 . in order to exclude pneumonia a repeat pa and lateral chest radiograph once the edema has resolved should be considered as current underlying parenchymal disease limits evaluation . 3 . a right picc tip is seen at least up to the low svc .

interval placement of left chest tube with reexpansion of the left lung , with opacity / consolidation in the left mid - to - lower lung fields with shift of the mediastinum to the left may be due to partial lung collapse , although underlying pulmonary contusion / hemorrhage is may be present . the left chest tube appears to extend to the level of the medial left diaphragm and may encroach upon the mediastinum . left chest wall subcutaneous emphysema .
overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable . calcified hilar lymph nodes are consistent with known sarcoidosis . deformity of the right upper chest wall with some right lateral pleural thickening and scarring and volume loss in the right medial lung base are stable . the left hemidiaphragm is now better visualized and no developing airspace consolidation is appreciated . no pulmonary edema . no pneumothorax . lower thoracic vertebroplasties best visualized on the lateral projection .
1 ) increased opacification of the left lower lobe is most likely a small left - sided pleural effusion with associated atelectasis in this postoperative patient . 2 ) stable small right - sided pleural effusion with associated atelectasis . 3 ) increased size of enlarged cardiac silhouette over multiple priors and when compared to baseline raises the possibility of pericardial effusion . findings were communicated by dr . ___ to ___ of cardiac surgery by phone at 12 :55 pm on ___ .
1 . interval clearance of left basilar consolidation . 2 . patchy right basilar opacities , which could be seen with minor atelectasis , but given the context clinical correlation is suggested regarding any possibility for recurrent or new aspiration pneumonitis at the right lung base . 3 . increased new interstitial abnormality , suggesting recurrence of fluid overload or mild - to - moderate pulmonary edema ; aspiration could also be considered . inflammation associated with atypical infectious process is probably less likely given the waxing and waning presentation .
left upper lobe pneumonia . recurrent infection in an area that is chronically abnormal may be due to atypical mycobacterial infection . findings discussed with dr . ___ by dr . ___ by telephone at 11 :30 p .m . on ___ at the time of discovery of these findings and at the time of wet read request . additional diagnostic consideration of atypical mycobacterical infection was discussed with dr . ___ by dr . ___ by phone at 8 :03 a .m . on ___ after attending radiologist review .

1 . linear opacity along the left apex extending down laterally may represent a new pneumothorax . alternatively , it could represent a skinfold . recommend a repeat chest radiograph for further clarification . 2 . increasing basilar opacities , likely from worsening re-expansion edema . there is a stable small left pleural effusion and likely a small residual right pleural effusion . scattered bilateral opacities are otherwise unchanged , likely reflective of the known multifocal pneumonia . results were discussed with dr . ___ ( ___ resident ) at 5 : 10 p .m . on ___ via telephone by dr . ___ at the time the findings were discovered .
1 . concern for small left - sided hydropneumothorax of uncertain etiology . 2 . 13 mm right lower lobe pulmonary nodule . differential includes nipple shadow , osseous lesion , or pulmonary parenchymal nodule . followup radiographs with oblique projections and nipple markers could be considered . alternatively , ct of the chest could also be performed for further characterization of the left - sided pleural process and the right lower lobe nodule . 3 . no confluent consolidation or pulmonary edema . dr . ___ communicated the above results to dr . ___ at 6 :03 pm ___ ___ by telephone .
1 . diffuse interstitial opacities in the right lung and very mild in left lung base , in view of history most likely reflect lung infection or asymmetric pulmonary edema . a possibility of lymphangitic spread of malignancy also needs to be ruled out in view of clinical history . 2 . irregularity of the mediastinal and hilar contours is attributed to the postradiation changes . 3 . ill - defined opacity in the left mild lung is likely atelectasis / scarring as suggested from a concurrent review of ___ ct . follow - up radiograph is recommended at 4 wks to monitor changes . above findings were discussed with dr . ___ on ___ at 5 :45 p .m .
